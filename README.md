# Welcome!

This repository contains the computational and simulation work done by Lowell Monis for Dr. Yuying Xie's STT 441 at Michigan State University during the Fall Semester of 2024.

## Quick Guide

In this repository, you will find Python code for simulations that were a part of seven of the twelve homework assignments assigned in this course. The question associated with the program is also included in each Jupyter notebook. If there is no file for a homework assignment, no simulation problem was assigned in that homework. You will also find a directory (`honors-option`) with an in-progress data analysis and modeling project that aims to perfect an election forecasting model for the United States. This was meant to be honors work for this class that required us to predict the electoral college makeup of the 2024 presidential elections, which I could not complete.
